SAPUI5 → CAP (CDS + Service + Logic) → HANA DB → Security (XSUAA) → BTP Deployment.



PHASE 1: Core Java (Absolute Foundation)

You can’t skip this. This is the base that separates actual Java devs from tutorial watchers.

🔹 Key Topics

Java Basics: Syntax, variables, data types, operators

Control Flow: if, switch, for, while, do-while

Methods: parameters, return types, overloading

OOP Concepts (non-negotiable):

Class, Object, Constructor

Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction

this, super, final, static

Access Modifiers: public, private, protected, default

Exception Handling: try-catch-finally, custom exceptions

Collections Framework: List, Set, Map, Queue, Iterator

Generics & Wrapper Classes

File I/O (java.io, java.nio)

Basic Debugging & Logging

🎯 Output of this phase:

You should be able to:

Build a small console app (like a Student Management System or Library System)

Use loops, collections, and OOP properly

Read and understand code written by others

👉 Timeframe: ~1.5–2 months if consistent (2 hours/day).

⚙️ PHASE 2: Advanced Java Concepts

This is where most people plateau. Don’t.
You need these to move into frameworks or enterprise work.

🔹 Key Topics

JDBC (Database connectivity)

Multithreading: Thread, Runnable, Executors, Synchronization

Concurrency utilities: ConcurrentHashMap, CountDownLatch, Semaphore

Lambda expressions & Functional Interfaces

Streams API (Java 8+)

Date & Time API (java.time)

Annotations

Unit Testing (JUnit 5, Mockito)

🎯 Output of this phase:

You should be able to:

Connect Java app to MySQL/PostgreSQL using JDBC

Write concurrent code that doesn’t break

Use streams and lambdas confidently

👉 Timeframe: ~1–1.5 months

🧠 PHASE 3: Java Ecosystem & Frameworks

Once you have strong core + advanced Java, it’s time to go enterprise.

🔹 Spring Framework (Main focus)

Spring Core (IOC, Beans, DI)

Spring Boot (for quick setup and REST APIs)

Spring MVC (Controllers, ViewResolvers)

Spring Data JPA (ORM & Database)

Spring Security (optional but useful)

RESTful APIs (JSON, HTTP methods, validation)

🔹 Databases

SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL basics)

ORM (Hibernate or JPA)

🔹 Build Tools

Maven or Gradle

🎯 Output of this phase:

You should be able to:

Build and run a full REST API backend (CRUD operations)

Integrate database with Spring Boot

Deploy locally and test with Postman

👉 Timeframe: ~2 months

🧩 PHASE 4: Real-World Development

Now you apply everything.

🔹 Projects to build:

Employee Management System (Full CRUD + DB + Spring Boot)

E-commerce backend (users, products, orders)

SAP-related Java integration (if targeting SAP dev — learn about OData, REST APIs, or CAP if you’re moving toward SAP BTP)

🔹 DevOps basics:

Git & GitHub

Build & Deploy using Docker (optional but makes you stand out)

CI/CD basics (Jenkins/GitHub Actions)

🔹 Interview Prep:

DSA (basic level): arrays, strings, collections, recursion, sorting

Java 8 features and commonly asked OOP questions

👉 Timeframe: ~2–3 months of project + revision work

⚡ BONUS: SAP Developer Alignment (since you mentioned SAP)

If your goal is Java inside the SAP ecosystem, focus after Phase 3 on:

SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform)

CAP (Cloud Application Programming Model — uses Java or Node.js)

OData + REST APIs integration

SAP HANA DB basics

SAP UI5 frontend (you’re already learning this)

This will position you as a Full Stack SAP Developer (Java + UI5 + BTP) — which pays significantly higher and is in high demand.

🧭 Recommended Learning Order (Summary)
Phase	Topics	Outcome
1	Core Java	You can code & debug logically
2	Advanced Java	You can handle real problems
3	Spring Boot + JPA	You can build enterprise apps
4	Projects + SAP BTP	You’re job/project ready
🔨 Tools to Master Along the Way

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

Git + GitHub

Maven/Gradle

MySQL or PostgreSQL

Postman (API testing)

Docker (optional but powerful)
